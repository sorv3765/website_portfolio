                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-light">The moment I was put through CT Scan before my chemotherapy session started. I asked myself what Siemen brand company have what field. It mentioned computer science or computer engineering. So I did my homework on figuring out which major i want to study when I start going back to college. I have enjoyed being on computers but when I first started taking C++ as my first course I fell in love with it hard. It made me realize I am capable of creating something in programming and not drawing, something I can create to help the world. In particular: artificial intelligence, robotics and building computers. These have stretched my knowledge of computers and I always strive to expand my knowledge of these topics further. This is why I would like to study computer science at university, as the mathematics behind the computing interests me and the code based projects will test my current knowledge of coding and I wish to improve dramatically and understand the skills behind it rather than using my current iteration approach.
I also research on Artificial Intelligence and research it in depthas well as taking some A.I. courses to replace my internship. I couldn't do internship that pay low or none because I was working full time and studying full time to cover my rents and bills. learning about this in University would be spectacular.
I chose Statistics because this subject has as gave me a better understanding of why algorithms and statstics are so valuable in our every day lives. After learnign C++, I learn more programming languages and linux, such as Unix/Linux, Java, Database/web development, .Net, and python. My knowledge adn my curiousity grew as I learn more programming language until I started learning python that's when Artificial Intelligence has been my goal for months into years. I have been coding for 5 years now and I have continue to do some self-taught projects such as learning to do some raspberry pi projects.
Along with turning my passion for coding into a real-life project I have also been aiding people in my local area with computer problems, this helps me to understand issues people have with their computer and it also helps develop my ability to talk to people of many ages. As I mentioned earlier I have been researching and reading a lot about artificial intelligence in terms of technology and psychology. These magazines and web articles I have read give me a large amount of insight into their respective topics and give me a chance to improve my skills learnt from them.
My main career aim is to work in the IT industry, possibly working on artificial intelligence. But I have had also had a passion to impart my knowledge onto others, to help me with this I have been aiding my two artificial intellegence teachers and my C++ teacher as well on how things are in the real world what I should be prepared for in this industry. I have found the skills I have developed over the past four years an experience I will treasure for the rest of my life.</p>
